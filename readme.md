Prism is a developer friendly, React & Backbone based theme for fast, API centric WordPress application development

Actually, it's a plugin to start. Actually actually, it will probably never be a theme.

WordPress is a super flexible way of holding all your stuff.

We need a super flexible way for viewing and manipulating all your stuff.

That's the name, Prism. It's a fast way of viewing the data in your application.

#Simple UI

Like millions of other users, I enjoy the simple and effective three tier UI commonly found in desktop applications.

It's non-pretentious hierarchy by design. Root access to information on the left. Branches in the middle. Leaf and node information on the right.

Clicking on an item moves you up and down the tree.
